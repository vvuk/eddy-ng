# BTT Eddy Survey Mode - Temperature-Independent Probing

## Overview

Survey mode is a temperature-independent probing method for the BTT Eddy probe, inspired by Cartographer's implementation. Unlike the standard TAP mode which requires temperature compensation (`tap_adjust_z`) and heavily depends on exact temperature ranges, Survey mode uses a polynomial model that provides consistent results across different temperatures.

## Key Differences from TAP Mode

| Feature | TAP Mode | Survey Mode |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Temperature Dependency | Yes - requires `tap_adjust_z` | No - temperature independent |
| Calibration Model | Piecewise interpolation | Full-range polynomial (degree 5-9) |
| Accuracy (RMSE) | ~0.01-0.05mm | ~0.10-0.15mm |
| Temperature Profiles | Required for consistency | Not needed |
| Stability | Varies with temperature | Consistent across temperatures |
| Touch Detection | Manual threshold setting | Automatic threshold detection |

## Installation

1. Copy the modified driver to Klipper:
```bash
cp probe_eddy_ng.py ~/klipper/klippy/extras/
sudo systemctl restart klipper
```

2. No configuration changes required - uses existing BTT Eddy config

## Complete Calibration Procedure

### Step 1: Basic Probe Calibration (if not done)
```gcode
# Only if probe is not calibrated
G28 X Y
PROBE_EDDY_NG_SETUP
# Follow instructions for manual Z=0 positioning
SAVE_CONFIG
```

### Step 2: Polynomial Calibration
```gcode
# After restart, home again
G28 X Y

# Polynomial calibration for Survey mode
PROBE_EDDY_NG_CALIBRATE_POLY
# Follow instructions for manual Z=0 positioning
SAVE_CONFIG
```

### Step 3: Automatic Threshold Detection
```gcode
# After restart, home again
G28 X Y

# Automatically find optimal touch threshold (optimized for speed)
PROBE_EDDY_NG_THRESHOLD_SCAN
# Takes ~2-3 minutes (optimized from 22 minutes), finds accurate bed contact point

# Check results
PROBE_EDDY_NG_THRESHOLD_STATUS
```

### Step 4: Survey Testing and Fine-tuning
```gcode
# Test Survey mode
PROBE_EDDY_NG_SURVEY Z_OFFSET=0
G1 Z0 F300
# Paper test to verify accuracy

# If adjustment needed (example values):
PROBE_EDDY_NG_SURVEY Z_OFFSET=-0.05  # For tighter contact
PROBE_EDDY_NG_SURVEY Z_OFFSET=0.05   # For looser contact
```

### Step 5: Create Production Macro
```ini
# Add to printer.cfg
[gcode_macro SURVEY]
gcode:
    PROBE_EDDY_NG_SURVEY Z_OFFSET=-0.05 {rawparams}  # Your calibrated offset
```

## Daily Usage

### With Saved Threshold (Recommended)
```gcode
# After initial threshold scan and save
G28 X Y
SURVEY  # Uses saved threshold from config
```

### Without Saved Threshold  
```gcode
# After printer power-on
G28 X Y
PROBE_EDDY_NG_THRESHOLD_SCAN  # Detect threshold (2-3 mins, optimized)
PROBE_EDDY_NG_THRESHOLD_SAVE  # Save threshold to config
SAVE_CONFIG                    # Make permanent (restarts Klipper)
# After restart:
G28 X Y
SURVEY                         # Use saved threshold
```

## Technical Details

### Automatic Threshold Detection

The system uses a **sliding median filter algorithm** to detect bed contact:

1. **Frequency Analysis**: Monitors sensor frequency changes as nozzle approaches bed
2. **Rate Calculation**: Calculates first derivative (rate of frequency change)
3. **Acceleration Detection**: Calculates second derivative (acceleration of frequency change)
4. **Contact Detection**: Identifies moment when frequency growth rate significantly slows down
5. **Statistical Validation**: Uses median filtering to eliminate noise and ensure reliability

**Key Algorithm Features:**
- Detects contact when frequency growth rate drops by 50% or more
- Requires minimum frequency increase of 1.5% from baseline
- Uses 10-point sliding window for stability

### Polynomial Model

The Survey mode uses a 9th-degree polynomial fitted to the inverse frequency:
```python
height = polynomial(1/frequency)
```

The system automatically selects the optimal polynomial degree (5-9) based on RMSE during calibration.

### Temperature Independence

Unlike TAP mode which measures at a specific trigger height and applies temperature-based corrections, Survey mode:
1. Uses a full-range polynomial model instead of piecewise interpolation
2. Captures the entire frequency-to-height relationship
3. Provides consistent results without temperature profiles
4. Automatically adapts to current conditions through threshold detection
