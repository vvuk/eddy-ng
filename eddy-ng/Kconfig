    help
      Enable this ONLY if you are flashing firmware to an STM32F0 board that
      is NOT Cartographer hardware (e.g., Orbitool O2 toolboard).
      
      Cartographer probe hardware requires GPIO setup (PA15, PB4, PB5) for the
      LDC1612 sensor. Other STM32F0 boards that connect to an external eddy coil
      via I2C should disable this GPIO setup.
      
      Leave this DISABLED if you are using Cartographer hardware.
